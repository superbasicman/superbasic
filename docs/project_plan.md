# SuperBasic Finance - Project Plan

## Overview

This document provides a high-level roadmap for building SuperBasic Finance, an API-first personal finance platform. The plan is organized into phases with clear exit criteria, building from foundational infrastructure through core features to advanced capabilities. Each phase represents a deployable milestone that delivers user value while maintaining production quality.

**Current Status**: Phase 3.5 (Architecture Refactor) complete – ready for Phase 4 (Plaid Integration)

## Guiding Principles

- **API-first**: All features exposed via stable /v1 JSON endpoints
- **Thin client**: Web app consumes only public API, no direct database access
- **Security by design**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit logging from day one
- **Incremental delivery**: Each phase is independently deployable and valuable
- **Production-ready**: No "we'll fix it later" - proper error handling, logging, and testing throughout

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure ✅

**Goal**: Establish monorepo structure, tooling, and development workflow

**Status**: COMPLETE

### Deliverables

- [x] Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- [x] Turborepo build orchestration
- [x] TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- [x] Biome linting and formatting
- [x] Vitest and Playwright test infrastructure
- [x] API skeleton (Hono + Node adapter)
- [x] Web client skeleton (Vite + React 19)
- [x] Shared packages structure (@repo/\*)
- [x] Prisma setup with basic User model
- [x] Development scripts (dev, build, test, lint)

### Exit Criteria

- ✅ `pnpm install` completes without errors
- ✅ `pnpm dev` starts both API and web client
- ✅ `pnpm build` compiles all packages and apps
- ✅ `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` pass
- ✅ Basic health check endpoint returns 200
- ✅ Web client renders placeholder home page

**Spec**: `.kiro/specs/monorepo-initialization/`

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & Session Management ✅

**Goal**: Secure user authentication with Auth.js, JWT sessions, and protected routes

**Status**: COMPLETE

### Deliverables

- [x] Auth.js configuration with Credentials provider
- [x] Password hashing utilities (bcrypt)
- [x] JWT session management with httpOnly cookies
- [x] Authentication middleware for protected routes
- [x] User registration endpoint (POST /v1/register)
- [x] Login endpoint (POST /v1/login)
- [x] Logout endpoint (POST /v1/logout)
- [x] Session endpoint (GET /v1/me)
- [x] CORS middleware with credentials support
- [x] Rate limiting on auth endpoints (10 req/min per IP)
- [x] Authentication event emitter for audit logging
- [x] Web client auth context provider
- [x] Login and registration UI pages
- [x] Protected route wrapper component
- [x] Audit logging with structured Pino logger
- [x] Profiles table for user preferences and business data
- [x] User/profile reference strategy (users.id for auth, profiles.id for business logic)
- [x] Middleware enhancement to attach both userId and profileId
- [x] Prisma client caching fix for schema updates

### Exit Criteria

- ✅ Users can register with email/password
- ✅ Users can log in and receive httpOnly session cookie
- ✅ Session persists across page refreshes (30-day expiration)
- ✅ Protected API routes return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- ✅ Users can log out and session is cleared
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (10 req/min per IP)
- ✅ All auth events logged with user ID, timestamp, IP, success/failure
- ✅ Upstash Redis configured and rate limiting verified working
- ✅ Sliding window rate limiter implemented with Redis sorted sets
- ✅ Integration tests cover registration, login, logout, session flows
- ✅ E2E tests verify complete authentication journey (29 comprehensive tests)
- ✅ One-command E2E test runner with automatic server management
- ✅ Profiles table created with migration and backfill script
- ✅ Auth middleware attaches both userId (auth) and profileId (business logic)
- ✅ All 102 tests passing (unit, integration, and E2E)

**Specs**:

- `.kiro/specs/authentication-foundation/` - Core authentication implementation
- `.kiro/specs/authentication-testing/` - Comprehensive test suite

**Notes**: Core authentication functionality is complete and production-ready with comprehensive test coverage. Rate limiting is fully implemented with Upstash Redis using a sliding window algorithm. The system gracefully fails open if Redis becomes unavailable. Phase 2 completed with 102 tests passing (unit, integration, and E2E). The profiles table separates Auth.js identity (users) from user preferences/business data (profiles), with middleware attaching both IDs to request context. A Prisma client caching fix ensures schema updates are picked up automatically.

**Post-Phase 3 Update**: Test suite expanded to 225 tests after API Key Management implementation. Phase 2.1 migration must maintain all 225 tests in passing state.

---

## Phase 2.1: Full Auth.js Migration (OAuth + Magic Links) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Goal**: Migrate from hybrid Auth.js approach to full Auth.js implementation with OAuth providers and magic link support  
**Documentation**: `docs/phase-2.1-readme.md`

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Auth.js migration delivered 2025-10-27)

**Context**: Phase 2 implemented a hybrid approach using Auth.js utilities (`encode`/`decode`) with custom Hono routes. This phase completes the Auth.js migration to enable OAuth (Google) and magic link authentication while maintaining backward compatibility with existing sessions and PAT tokens. The implementation keeps the provider architecture extensible so additional providers (GitHub, Apple) can be added in Phase 16 once we secure the required accounts.

### Deliverables

- [x] Install Auth.js handler using `@auth/core` (Hono integration)
- [x] Replace custom auth routes with Auth.js request handlers mounted at `/v1/auth`
- [x] Configure Google OAuth provider (Task 6 complete – 2025-10-22)
- [x] Configure email provider for magic links (Resend integration)
- [x] Migrate existing Credentials provider to Auth.js handlers (16 tests passing)
- [x] Update authentication middleware for Auth.js session format
- [x] Ensure PAT authentication (Phase 3) remains functional (241 tests passing)
- [x] Update CORS configuration for OAuth callbacks
- [x] Add OAuth and email provider configuration to environment files
- [x] Update web client to use Auth.js sign-in/sign-out flows
- [x] Add Google OAuth button with CSRF handling
- [x] Add "Sign in with magic link" option in the web client
- [x] Preserve existing user sessions (JWT compatibility maintained)
- [x] Update test suites for Auth.js handlers (225+ tests migrated)
- [x] Add OAuth flow tests with mocked provider responses
- [x] Add magic link flow tests (email + rate limiting)
- [x] Update API documentation with OAuth and magic link flows

### Exit Criteria

- [x] Users can log in with Google OAuth
- [x] Architecture supports adding additional OAuth providers (GitHub, Apple) in Phase 16 without refactor
- [x] Users can request magic link via email
- [x] Magic link logs user in without password
- [x] Existing email/password authentication still works
- [x] Existing sessions remain valid (no forced logout)
- [x] PAT authentication (Bearer tokens) unaffected
- [x] OAuth accounts linked to existing users by email
- [x] New OAuth users automatically create profile records
- [x] All 225+ tests passing with Auth.js handlers (PAT suite intact)
- [x] E2E coverage confirmed for OAuth and magic link flows
- [x] Documentation updated with OAuth setup instructions

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 2.1.1: Auth.js Handler Integration (Week 1)**

1. Install `@auth/hono` adapter
2. Create Auth.js handler at `/v1/auth/*` (parallel to existing routes)
3. Configure Credentials provider (reuse existing logic)
4. Test Auth.js handlers alongside custom routes
5. Verify session format compatibility

**Phase 2.1.2: OAuth Provider Setup (Week 1)** - ✅ COMPLETE

1. ✅ Register Google OAuth app (Task 6 complete - 2025-10-22)
2. ✅ Configure Google provider in Auth.js config
3. ✅ Add Google OAuth button to login page with CSRF token handling
4. ✅ OAuth callback handling (built into Auth.js)
5. ✅ Test Google OAuth flow in development (automated + manual smoke checks)

_Note_: Additional OAuth providers (GitHub, Apple) deferred to Phase 16 (Advanced Features) to focus on core functionality

**Phase 2.1.3: Magic Link Setup (Week 2)**

1. ✅ Configure email service (Resend)
2. ✅ Add Email provider to Auth.js config
3. ✅ Create email templates for magic links
4. ✅ Test magic link flow end-to-end
5. ✅ Add "Sign in with email" UI

**Phase 2.1.4: Migration and Cutover (Week 2-3)**

1. ✅ Update auth middleware to handle Auth.js sessions
2. ✅ Deprecate custom auth routes (kept rollback plan documented)
3. ✅ Migrate existing tests to Auth.js handlers
4. ✅ Update web client to use Auth.js methods
5. ✅ Deploy to preview environment for testing
6. ✅ Monitor for issues, rollback if needed
7. ✅ Remove deprecated custom routes after 1 week

**Phase 2.1.5: Testing and Documentation (Week 3)**

1. ✅ Add OAuth flow integration tests
2. ✅ Add magic link flow tests
3. ✅ Update E2E tests for new auth flows
4. ✅ Update API documentation
5. ✅ Create OAuth setup guide for developers
6. ✅ Document migration process

### Technical Considerations

**Backward Compatibility:**

- Existing JWT sessions must remain valid during migration
- PAT authentication (Phase 3) must continue working unchanged
- Custom `/v1/login`, `/v1/register` routes kept temporarily for rollback

**Session Format:**

- Auth.js uses same JWT structure we implemented
- `userId` and `profileId` still attached to context
- No database schema changes required (tables already exist)

**OAuth Account Linking:**

- Match OAuth email to existing user accounts
- Create new user + profile if email not found
- Handle email verification status from OAuth providers

**Magic Link Security:**

- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- One-time use only (stored in `verification_tokens` table)
- Rate limit magic link requests (3 per hour per email)

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# OAuth Providers
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Email Provider (for magic links)
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://...
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@superbasicfinance.com

# Note: Additional OAuth providers (GitHub, Apple) will be added in Phase 16
```

### Dependencies

**Completed Prerequisites:**

- ✅ Phase 1: Monorepo infrastructure
- ✅ Phase 2: Auth.js tables and utilities
- ✅ Phase 3: PAT authentication (must not break)
- ✅ Auth.js config file exists (`packages/auth/src/config.ts`)
- ✅ Database schema has Auth.js tables

**External Dependencies:**
- ✅ Google OAuth app (registered and configured)
- Email service account (SendGrid, Postmark, or Resend)
- Domain for OAuth callbacks (can use localhost for development)
- _Note_: GitHub and Apple OAuth accounts deferred to Phase 16

**Blockers:**

- None (can start immediately)

### Success Metrics

- [ ] 100% of existing tests passing after migration (225 tests including Phase 3 PAT tests)
- [ ] 0 forced logouts during migration (session compatibility)
- [ ] < 5 second OAuth flow completion time
- [ ] < 30 second magic link delivery time
- [ ] > 95% OAuth success rate (excluding user cancellations)
- [ ] PAT authentication latency unchanged (critical: Bearer token auth must work identically)

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. Revert to custom auth routes (keep them during migration)
2. Disable Auth.js handlers at `/v1/auth/*`
3. Web client falls back to `/v1/login` and `/v1/register`
4. Investigate issues in preview environment
5. Fix and redeploy when ready

### Post-Migration Cleanup

After 1 week of successful Auth.js operation:

- [ ] Remove custom `/v1/login`, `/v1/register`, `/v1/logout` routes
- [ ] Remove custom JWT encoding logic (use Auth.js only)
- [ ] Archive migration documentation
- [ ] Update steering docs to reflect Auth.js as primary auth

**Spec**: `.kiro/specs/authjs-migration/` (to be created)

---

## Phase 3: API Key Management (PATs) ✅ **NEEDS REVALIDATION**

**Goal**: Enable programmatic API access with Personal Access Tokens

**Status**: COMPLETE (225 tests passing) - Will be retested after Phase 2.1 Auth.js migration completes

**Status**: COMPLETE - All 12 tasks implemented and tested with 225 passing tests

### Deliverables

- [x] PAT generation with secure random tokens (sbf\_ prefix + base64url encoding)
- [x] Token hashing (SHA-256) before database storage
- [x] Token format validation and scope utilities
- [x] Unit tests for token generation, hashing, and scope validation (64 tests passing)
- [x] PAT CRUD endpoints (POST /v1/tokens, GET /v1/tokens, DELETE /v1/tokens/:id, PATCH /v1/tokens/:id)
- [x] Bearer token authentication middleware (separate from session auth)
- [x] Token scopes and permissions (read:profile, write:profile, read:transactions, write:transactions, etc.)
- [x] Token expiration and revocation
- [x] Last used timestamp tracking
- [x] Web UI for managing API keys
- [x] Token creation flow (show plaintext once, then hash)
- [x] Token list with masked values and metadata
- [x] Token revocation with confirmation dialog
- [x] Scope enforcement on protected endpoints (GET /v1/me, PATCH /v1/me)
- [x] Rate limiting for token operations
- [x] Audit logging for token lifecycle events
- [x] API documentation (docs/api-authentication.md)

### Exit Criteria

- ✅ Users can create API keys with custom names and scopes
- ✅ Plaintext token shown once on creation, then never again
- ✅ API requests with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` authenticate successfully
- ✅ Invalid or expired tokens return 401
- ✅ Token scopes enforced on protected endpoints (403 with required scope in error)
- ✅ Users can list and revoke their tokens
- ✅ Audit log records token creation, usage, and revocation
- ✅ Integration tests cover token lifecycle (225 tests passing)
- ✅ Documentation includes API authentication guide

**Spec**: `.kiro/specs/api-key-management/`

**Notes**: Phase 3 is fully complete with comprehensive test coverage. All 225 API tests pass, including 13 scope enforcement tests. Test isolation issue was resolved by adding `vi.unmock('@repo/database')` to all integration test files. The system supports both session authentication (full access) and PAT authentication (scope-restricted access). See `docs/test-isolation-fix.md` for details on the test infrastructure improvements.

## Phase 3.5: Architecture Refactor (Service/Repository Pattern) ✅

**Goal**: Extract business logic from route handlers to service/repository layers before Phase 4

**Status**: COMPLETE (2025-11-01)

**Rationale**: Phase 1-3 implemented business logic directly in route handlers (fat controllers). Before adding Phase 4 complexity (Plaid integration), we're refactoring existing code to follow the layered architecture pattern defined in `best-practices.md`. This creates a consistent foundation and prevents mixing patterns.

### Deliverables

  - [x] `token-types.ts` - Domain types and interfaces
  - [x] Unit tests for service layer (mocked repositories)
  - [x] Integration tests for repository layer (test database)
- [x] Create `packages/core/src/profiles/` domain structure
  - [x] `profile-service.ts` - Business logic for profile operations
  - [x] `profile-repository.ts` - Data access layer for profiles

  - [x] `profile-types.ts` - Domain types and interfaces
  - [x] Unit and integration tests
- [x] Create `packages/core/src/users/` domain structure
  - [x] `user-service.ts` - Business logic for user registration
  - [x] `user-repository.ts` - Data access layer for users

  - [x] `user-types.ts` - Domain types and interfaces
  - [x] Unit and integration tests
- [x] Create dependency injection setup
  - [x] `apps/api/src/services/index.ts` - Service registry
  - [x] Initialize repositories with Prisma client
  - [x] Initialize services with repository dependencies
- [ ] Refactor token route handlers to thin controllers
  - [x] `POST /v1/tokens` - Delegate to `tokenService.createToken()`
  - [x] `GET /v1/tokens` - Delegate to `tokenService.listTokens()`
  - [x] `PATCH /v1/tokens/:id` - Delegate to `tokenService.updateToken()`
  - [x] `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id` - Delegate to `tokenService.revokeToken()`
- [x] Refactor profile route handlers to thin controllers
  - [x] `GET /v1/me` - Delegate to `profileService.getCurrentProfile()`
  - [x] `PATCH /v1/me` - Delegate to `profileService.updateProfile()`
- [x] Refactor registration route handler
  - [x] `POST /v1/register` - Delegate to `userService.registerUser()`
- [x] Split rate limit middleware into separate files
  - [x] `middleware/rate-limit/auth-rate-limit.ts`
  - [x] `middleware/rate-limit/token-rate-limit.ts`
  - [x] `middleware/rate-limit/magic-link-rate-limit.ts`
  - [x] `middleware/rate-limit/index.ts` - Exports
- [x] Add Zod validation schemas for profile routes
  - [x] Replace inline validation with Zod schemas
  - [x] Consistent with other routes
- [ ] Update all tests to work with new architecture
  - [x] Add new unit tests for services
  - [x] Add integration tests for repositories
  - [x] Re-run full suite after route refactors

### Progress Notes (2025-10-31)

- Tokens, profiles, and users domain layers are implemented with passing unit/integration tests.
- Service registry (`apps/api/src/services/index.ts`) is live and consumed by register/profile routes.
- Token route refactor is complete. All CRUD handlers delegate to `tokenService` and map domain errors to HTTP responses.
- Full-suite verification ran after the refactor (`pnpm test`) with 234 tests passing across packages.

### Exit Criteria

- ✅ All route handlers are thin (< 30 lines of actual logic)
- ✅ All business logic extracted to `packages/core` services
- ✅ All database access isolated in repositories
- ✅ Domain errors defined for each domain
- ✅ Dependency injection setup complete
- ✅ TypeScript builds with no errors (verified 2025-11-01)
- ✅ Rate limit middleware split into focused files
- ✅ Profile routes use Zod validation
- ✅ Code follows Single Responsibility Principle end-to-end
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect final architecture

**Note on Tests:** Test suite requires environment configuration (.env.test with DATABASE_URL and credentials). Tests pass on local machines with proper configuration. Build and typecheck verified passing in Gitpod environment.

### Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Average route handler < 25 lines (currently 60-80 lines)
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% of existing test coverage
- **Build Time**: No significant increase in build time
- **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript errors

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These concerns span multiple phases and should be addressed continuously:

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Domain logic in @repo/core, utilities in @repo/auth
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints with real database (test instance)
- **E2E tests**: Critical user flows (login, bank connection, transaction sync)
- **Contract tests**: OpenAPI spec diffing to prevent breaking changes
- **Performance tests**: Load testing before production launch

### Documentation

- **API documentation**: Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec
- **SDK documentation**: Usage examples and API reference
- **Developer guides**: Authentication, webhooks, rate limiting
- **User guides**: Getting started, connecting banks, creating budgets
- **Runbooks**: Deployment, incident response, database operations

### Documentation Maintenance

Documentation should be updated when implementing features that were marked as "future" in earlier phases:

- **Phase 6** (Workspace Multi-Tenancy):
  - Update `docs/api-authentication.md` to add workspace scopes (`read:workspaces`, `write:workspaces`)
  - Update scope enforcement table with workspace endpoints
- **Phase 13** (Rate Limiting & Security):
  - Update `docs/api-authentication.md` to document per-token rate limits
  - Add IP address tracking and security monitoring features
  - Update rate limiting section with tier-based limits
- **Phase 11** (OpenAPI Spec):
  - Migrate manual API documentation to auto-generated OpenAPI docs
  - Ensure `docs/api-authentication.md` links to interactive Swagger UI
  - Add error code standardization (ERR_INVALID_TOKEN, etc.)

**Best Practice**: When marking a feature as "future" in documentation, add a TODO comment with the phase number where it should be implemented. Example: `<!-- TODO: Phase 6 - Add workspace scopes -->`

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Lint and typecheck**: Run on every commit
- **Unit and integration tests**: Run on every PR
- **E2E tests**: Run on main branch and before deployment
- **Build and deploy**: Automatic deployment to preview environments
- **Production deployment**: Manual approval after staging verification

### Security Practices

- **Dependency updates**: Weekly automated PRs (Dependabot or Renovate)
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Snyk or similar in CI pipeline
- **Secret management**: Environment variables, never committed
- **Audit logging**: All sensitive actions logged with context
- **Incident response**: Documented procedures and on-call rotation

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- **Plaid API changes**: Monitor Plaid changelog, maintain adapter layer
- **Database performance**: Index optimization, read replicas, query monitoring
- **Third-party service outages**: Graceful degradation, status page, retries
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular audits, dependency scanning, bug bounty

### Business Risks

- **Low user adoption**: User research, MVP validation, iterative feedback
- **High churn rate**: Onboarding optimization, feature engagement tracking
- **Competitive pressure**: Differentiation through API-first approach, developer tools
- **Regulatory compliance**: Legal counsel, GDPR/CCPA compliance, data residency

### Operational Risks

- **Team capacity**: Prioritize ruthlessly, defer non-critical features
- **Technical debt**: Allocate 20% of time to refactoring and improvements
- **Burnout**: Sustainable pace, clear scope, celebrate milestones
- **Scope creep**: Strict phase boundaries, defer enhancements to later phases

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies

- **Plaid account**: Required for Phase 4 (bank connections)
- **Stripe account**: Required for Phase 7 (billing)
- **Upstash account**: Required for Phase 5 (background jobs) - ✅ Already configured for rate limiting
- **Neon database**: Required for all phases - ✅ Already set up
- **Email service**: Required for Phase 14 (notifications)
- **Apple Developer account**: Required for Phase 15 (iOS app)
- **Google Play Developer account**: Required for Phase 15 (Android app)

### Internal Blockers

- **Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3**: API keys require user authentication
- **Phase 4 must complete before Phase 5**: Transaction sync requires bank connections
- **Phase 6 can run parallel to Phase 7**: Workspaces and billing are independent
- **Phase 11 should complete before Phase 15**: Mobile app benefits from generated SDK
- **Phase 12-13 should complete before Phase 17**: Observability and security required for launch

3. **Deploy to preview environment** (optional but recommended)
   - Set up Vercel project for API and web client
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel
   - Deploy and test authentication flow in preview environment
   - Verify CORS and cookie behavior across domains

---

## Appendix A: Architecture Patterns

### Service/Repository Pattern

All business logic follows a three-layer architecture established in Phase 3.5:

**Route Handlers (Thin Controllers):**
- Extract request data
- Call service methods
- Map domain errors to HTTP status codes
- Return formatted responses
- Target: < 30 lines per handler

**Service Layer (`packages/core/src/*/`):**
- Business logic and validation
- Orchestrates repository calls
- Emits audit events
- Throws domain-specific errors
- No direct database access

**Repository Layer (`packages/core/src/*/`):**
- Data access only
- Prisma queries
- No business logic
- Returns domain types

**Example:**
```typescript
// Route Handler (apps/api/src/routes/v1/tokens/create.ts)
async (c) => {
  const { name, scopes } = c.req.valid('json');
  try {
    const result = await tokenService.createToken({ userId, name, scopes });
    return c.json(result, 201);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof DuplicateTokenNameError) {
      return c.json({ error: error.message }, 409);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

// Service Layer (packages/core/src/tokens/token-service.ts)
async createToken(params) {
  // Validate business rules
  if (await this.repository.existsByName(params.name)) {
    throw new DuplicateTokenNameError();
  }
  // Generate token
  const token = generateSecureToken();
  // Store in database
  return await this.repository.create({ ...params, token });
}

// Repository Layer (packages/core/src/tokens/token-repository.ts)
async create(data) {
  return await this.prisma.apiKey.create({ data });
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

**Domain Errors:**
- Custom error classes per domain (e.g., `TokenNotFoundError`)
- Thrown by service layer
- Caught by route handlers
- Mapped to HTTP status codes

**Unexpected Errors:**
- Caught by global error handler
- Logged with full context
- Return 500 with generic message
- Never expose internal details

**Validation Errors:**
- Zod schemas at route level
- Return 400 with validation details
- Consistent error format

### Authentication & Authorization

**Session Authentication:**
- Auth.js with JWT sessions
- httpOnly cookies
- 30-day expiration
- Full access to all endpoints

**PAT Authentication:**
- Bearer token in Authorization header
- Scope-based permissions
- Rate limited per token
- Tracked usage (lastUsedAt, IP)

**Scope Enforcement:**
```typescript
// Middleware checks scopes
requireScope('read:profile')

// Valid scopes:
// - read:profile, write:profile
// - read:transactions, write:transactions
// - read:connections, write:connections
// - read:budgets, write:budgets
```

      // Arrange
      const input = { ... };
      
      // Act
      const result = await service.methodName(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Database
