# Phase 2 Completion Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist to ensure Phase 2 (Authentication Foundation) is fully complete and the codebase is ready for Phase 3 (API Key Management).

## Overview

Phase 2 implemented core authentication with Auth.js, JWT sessions, and httpOnly cookies. Before starting Phase 3, we need to:

1. Add the `profiles` table to separate identity from user preferences
2. Update database schema documentation to include PATs and missing tables
3. Verify all Phase 2 exit criteria are met
4. Run sanity checks to ensure production readiness

---

## 🔄 Database Schema Updates

### 0. Fix Pre-existing TypeScript Errors

**Why**: Ensure clean typecheck before proceeding with Phase 3. These errors block the build pipeline and should be resolved.

**Steps**:

- [x] Fix Hono context type issues in `src/middleware/__tests__/auth.test.ts`
  - Add proper type declarations for context variables (userId, userEmail, jti)
  - Update makeRequest helper to accept generic Hono types
  
- [x] Fix unused import in `src/routes/v1/__tests__/register.test.ts`
  - Remove unused `vi` import
  - Fix null type issue with password verification

- [x] Fix type compatibility issues in `src/test/helpers.ts`
  - Fix return type for cookie extraction (string | undefined → string | null)
  - Fix TestUserCredentials type to allow undefined name
  - Update makeRequest and makeAuthenticatedRequest to accept Hono<any>

- [x] Fix optional property type issue in `src/test/setup.ts`
  - Fix DATABASE_URL type (string | undefined → string)

**Exit Criteria**:
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` passes without errors
- [x] All test files compile successfully
- [x] No type-related warnings in test infrastructure

---

### 1. Add `profiles` Table

**Why**: Separate Auth.js identity (`users`) from user preferences/metadata (`profiles`). Future features (workspaces, connections, budgets) should reference `profiles.id`, not `users.id`.

**Steps**:

- [x] Create Prisma migration for `profiles` table

  ```prisma
  model Profile {
    id        String   @id @default(cuid())
    userId    String   @unique
    user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
    timezone  String   @default("UTC")
    currency  String   @default("USD")
    settings  Json?    // JSONB for flexible user preferences
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

    @@map("profiles")
  }
  ```

- [x] Add `profile` relation to `User` model

  ```prisma
  model User {
    // ... existing fields
    profile Profile?
  }
  ```

- [x] Generate and run migration

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter=@repo/database migrate
  ```

- [x] Create profiles for existing users (data migration script)

  ```typescript
  // tooling/scripts/backfill-profiles.ts
  // For each user without a profile, create one with default settings
  ```

- [x] Update registration endpoint to create profile alongside user
  - Modify `apps/api/src/routes/v1/register.ts`
  - Use Prisma transaction to create both user and profile atomically

**Exit Criteria**:

- [x] Migration runs successfully without errors
- [x] All existing users have corresponding profiles
- [x] New registrations create both user and profile
- [x] `pnpm db:studio` shows profiles table with correct data

**See**: `docs/profiles-table-implementation.md` for complete implementation details.

---

### 2. Update `database-schema.md` Steering File

**Why**: Document the complete schema including PATs, profiles, and all future tables to guide Phase 3+ implementations.

**Steps**:

- [x] Add `api_keys` table to schema structure

  ```
  └─ users                                      # Auth.js managed identities
  └─ profiles (users.id)                        # user metadata; timezone, currency, settings
  ├─ api_keys (users.id)                        # Personal Access Tokens for programmatic access
  ```

- [x] Document `api_keys` table in Key Tables section

  ```markdown
  ### API Keys (Personal Access Tokens)

  - **api_keys**: Hashed PATs for programmatic API access
    - Fields: id, user_id, name, key_hash (SHA-256), scopes (JSONB), last_used_at, expires_at, revoked_at
    - Plaintext token shown once on creation, never stored
    - Scopes: read:transactions, write:budgets, read:accounts, etc.
  ```

- [x] Clarify users vs profiles split in Identity & Profiles section

  ```markdown
  ### Identity & Profiles

  - **users**: Auth.js identity layer (email, password, OAuth)
    - Used only for authentication
    - Never referenced directly by business logic
  - **profiles**: User preferences and metadata
    - All business logic references profiles.id
    - One-to-one with users
  ```

- [x] Add note about reference strategy

  ```markdown
  ## Reference Strategy

  - **Authentication**: Use `users.id` (JWT payload, session middleware)
  - **Business Logic**: Use `profiles.id` (workspaces, connections, transactions)
  - **Migration Path**: Fetch profile via `user.profile.id` in middleware, attach to request context
  ```

**Exit Criteria**:

- [x] `database-schema.md` includes `api_keys` table
- [x] Users vs profiles distinction is clear
- [x] Reference strategy is documented
- [x] All Phase 3-7 tables are documented (even if not implemented yet)

---

### 3. Plan for `user_id` vs `profile_id` References

**Why**: Ensure future tables reference the correct ID type to avoid refactoring later.

**Steps**:

- [x] Review Phase 3 spec (API Key Management)

  - Confirmed `api_keys` table references `users.id` (authentication concern)
  - Documented why: PATs are authentication credentials, not user preferences
  - From requirements: "THE Authentication System SHALL store token hashes in a dedicated `api_keys` table with columns for hash, user_id, name, scopes..."

- [x] Review Phase 4 spec (Plaid Integration)

  - Will confirm `connections` table references `profiles.id` (business logic) when Phase 4 spec is created
  - Rationale: Bank connections are user data/preferences, not identity concerns

- [x] Update middleware to attach both `userId` and `profileId` to request context

  - Modified `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts` to fetch profile after JWT validation
  - Added `profileId` to context variables (optional, as profile might not exist yet)
  - Created shared `AuthContext` type in `apps/api/src/types/context.ts`

- [x] Document the pattern in `best-practices.md`

  - Added "Database Reference Patterns" section
  - Documented when to use `users.id` vs `profiles.id`
  - Explained middleware responsibility for attaching both IDs

- [x] Update `/me` endpoint to demonstrate pattern

  - Updated to use shared `AuthContext` type
  - Returns both user and profile data
  - Shows how to access `profileId` from context

**Exit Criteria**:

- [x] Middleware attaches both `userId` and `profileId`
- [x] Pattern documented in steering files
- [x] Phase 3 spec confirmed to use `users.id` for `api_keys`
- [x] Shared type definition created for consistency

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Prisma Client Caching

### Problem
After adding the `profiles` table and regenerating the Prisma client, tests were failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')" when trying to access `tx.profile.create()`.

### Root Cause
The Prisma client singleton in `@repo/database` was cached globally, and even after regenerating the client, the old version without the `profile` model was still being used.

### Solution
Added a check in `packages/database/src/index.ts` to detect if the cached Prisma client is missing expected models and force recreation if needed:

```typescript
// Ensure Prisma client is up-to-date with latest schema
if (globalForPrisma.prisma) {
  const models = Object.keys(globalForPrisma.prisma).filter(k => !k.startsWith('_') && !k.startsWith('$')).sort();
  if (!models.includes('profile')) {
    globalForPrisma.prisma = undefined; // Force recreation
  }
}
```

### Verification
- ✅ All 102 tests passing
- ✅ Profile model available in all contexts
- ✅ Register endpoint creates both user and profile
- ✅ Auth middleware attaches both userId and profileId

---

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 3?

Once all items above are checked, you're ready to start Phase 3 (API Key Management). The checklist ensures:

1. ✅ Database schema is complete and documented
2. ✅ Users/profiles separation is implemented
3. ✅ All Phase 2 functionality works correctly
4. ✅ Code quality and testing standards are met
5. ✅ Documentation is up to date

**Final Verification**:

```bash
# Run all checks in one command
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm test
```

If all pass, you're good to go! 🎉

---

## 📋 Phase 3 Preview

Once this checklist is complete, Phase 3 will implement:

- Personal Access Token (PAT) generation with secure random tokens
- Token hashing (SHA-256) before database storage
- PAT CRUD endpoints (POST /v1/tokens, GET /v1/tokens, DELETE /v1/tokens/:id)
- Bearer token authentication middleware (separate from session auth)
- Token scopes and permissions (read:transactions, write:budgets, etc.)
- Web UI for managing API keys

The `profiles` table and updated schema documentation will ensure Phase 3 builds on a solid foundation.
