# Task 9: Magic Link Email Template - Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Phase**: 2.1 - Auth.js Migration  
**Sub-Phase**: 3 - Magic Link Setup

## Overview

Task 9 required creating an email template for magic link authentication. Upon investigation, we discovered the template was already implemented in Task 7 as part of the `sendMagicLinkEmail()` function in `packages/auth/src/email.ts`.

## What Was Delivered

### Email Template Implementation

The template was already created with:

1. **HTML Version**:
   - Styled heading with brand color (#2563eb)
   - Blue "Sign In" button with proper styling
   - Plain text link as fallback
   - 24-hour expiration notice
   - Support contact information
   - Responsive design with max-width 600px

2. **Plain Text Version**:
   - Clean text-only format
   - Clickable magic link URL
   - Same expiration and support information
   - Fallback for email clients without HTML support

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `packages/auth/src/__tests__/email.test.ts`:

- ✅ Verifies email is sent with correct recipient and sender
- ✅ Confirms magic link URL is included in both HTML and text
- ✅ Validates 24-hour expiration notice is present
- ✅ Checks support contact email is included
- ✅ Tests EMAIL_FROM environment variable usage
- ✅ Tests fallback to default sender

**Test Results**: 6/6 tests passing

### Template Content

**Subject**: Sign in to SuperBasic Finance

**Key Elements**:
- Heading: "Sign in to SuperBasic Finance"
- Call-to-action button (HTML only)
- Plain text link (both versions)
- Expiration notice: "This link will expire in 24 hours"
- Security notice: "If you didn't request this email, you can safely ignore it"
- Support contact: "Need help? Contact us at support@superbasicfinance.com"

## Technical Details

### Implementation Location

- **File**: `packages/auth/src/email.ts`
- **Function**: `sendMagicLinkEmail({ to, url })`
- **Email Service**: Resend (configured in Task 7)
- **Sender**: `noreply@superbasicfinance.com` (verified domain)

### Integration with Auth.js

The template is used by Auth.js Email provider via custom `sendVerificationRequest` callback in `packages/auth/src/config.ts`:

```typescript
Email({
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM ?? "onboard@resend.com",
  sendVerificationRequest: async ({ identifier: email, url }) => {
    await sendMagicLinkEmail({ to: email, url });
  },
})
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Code Review
```bash
# View email template implementation
grep -A 50 "sendMagicLinkEmail" packages/auth/src/email.ts
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
# Run email template tests
pnpm --filter=@repo/auth test -- email
# Result: 6/6 tests passing
```

### 3. Visual Verification
Template includes all required elements:
- ✅ Magic link URL (button + plain text)
- ✅ 24-hour expiration notice
- ✅ Support contact email
- ✅ Security notice for unsolicited emails
- ✅ Responsive HTML design
- ✅ Plain text fallback
