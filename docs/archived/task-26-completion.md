# Task 26: Deprecate Custom Auth Routes - Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: ✅ Complete (No Action Required)  
**Phase**: 2.1 - Auth.js Migration  
**Sub-Phase**: 5 - Web Client Integration and Cleanup

## Overview

Task 26 was to deprecate custom auth routes and ensure the web client uses Auth.js exclusively. Upon investigation, this task was already completed during earlier tasks in the migration.

## Findings

### 1. Custom Auth Routes Already Removed

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The custom auth routes (`/v1/auth/login`, `/v1/auth/register`) have already been removed from the codebase:

```bash
# Verified no custom auth route files exist
$ ls apps/api/src/routes/v1/
__tests__/  health.ts  me.ts  register.ts  tokens/

# No login.ts or custom auth files present
```

**Current State**:
- Only Auth.js handler mounted at `/v1/auth/*` (via `authApp`)
- Registration endpoint at `/v1/register` (not part of Auth.js - custom endpoint)
- No deprecated routes to mark

### 2. Web Client Uses Auth.js Exclusively

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The web client (`apps/web`) has been fully migrated to use Auth.js endpoints:

```bash
# Verified no references to old auth routes
$ grep -r "/v1/auth/login\|/v1/login" apps/web/src/
# No results - web client uses Auth.js endpoints only
```

**Current Implementation** (from `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`):
- `authApi.login()` → `/v1/auth/callback/credentials` (Auth.js)
- `authApi.loginWithGoogle()` → `/v1/auth/signin/google` (Auth.js)
- `authApi.requestMagicLink()` → `/v1/auth/signin/nodemailer` (Auth.js)
- `authApi.me()` → `/v1/auth/session` (Auth.js)
- `authApi.logout()` → `/v1/auth/signout` (Auth.js)
- `authApi.register()` → `/v1/register` (custom endpoint, not Auth.js)

### 3. CORS Configuration

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The task description mentioned CORS configuration, which is already properly set up in `apps/api/src/middleware/cors.ts`:

**Current Configuration**:
- ✅ Allows `http://localhost:*` (all ports for development)
- ✅ Allows `https://app.superbasicfinance.com` (production)
- ✅ Allows `https://*.vercel.app` (preview deployments)
- ✅ `credentials: true` enabled for cookie support
- ✅ Proper methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS
- ✅ Proper headers: Content-Type, Authorization

## Sanity Checks

All sanity checks from the task description pass:

### ✅ CORS Configuration Check

```bash
# Check CORS configuration
$ grep -A 10 "cors" apps/api/src/app.ts
# ✅ CORS middleware applied globally

# Verify CORS middleware implementation
$ cat apps/api/src/middleware/cors.ts
# ✅ Allows localhost:* (all ports)
# ✅ Allows production domain
# ✅ Allows Vercel preview deployments
# ✅ credentials: true enabled
```

### ✅ Web Client Uses Auth.js Only

```bash
# Check web client doesn't call custom routes
$ grep -r "/v1/auth/login\|/v1/auth/register" apps/web/src/
# ✅ No results - web client uses Auth.js endpoints only
```

### ✅ No Deprecated Routes to Monitor

```bash
# Check for custom auth route files
$ ls apps/api/src/routes/v1/auth/ 2>/dev/null
# ✅ Directory doesn't exist - no custom auth routes
```

## Why Task Was Already Complete

This task was implicitly completed during earlier tasks:

1. **Task 21** (Update API Client): Web client migrated to Auth.js endpoints
2. **Task 22** (Update AuthContext): OAuth callback handling implemented
3. **Task 23** (Add OAuth Buttons): UI updated to use Auth.js methods
4. **Earlier cleanup**: Custom auth routes removed when Auth.js handler was mounted

## Conclusion

**Task 26 is complete with no action required.** The system is already in the desired state:

- ✅ No custom auth routes exist to deprecate
- ✅ Web client uses Auth.js exclusively
- ✅ CORS properly configured for OAuth callbacks
- ✅ No monitoring needed (no deprecated routes to track)

## Next Steps

Proceed to **Task 27**: Remove Custom Auth Routes (After 1 Week)

**Note**: Task 27 description appears to be incorrect (says "Update API documentation" but title says "Remove Custom Auth Routes"). Since custom routes are already removed, Task 27 may also be complete or need clarification.
