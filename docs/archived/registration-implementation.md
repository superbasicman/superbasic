# Registration Implementation - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Context**: Task 23 follow-up - Wiring up registration functionality

## What Was Done

### 1. Wired Up Registration in Login.tsx

Updated `handleCreateAccount()` to:
- Call `register()` from AuthContext
- Validate password length (min 8 characters)
- Validate password confirmation match
- Handle errors and loading states
- Navigate to home page on success

### 2. Simplified Register.tsx

Converted Register page to a simple redirect:
- Redirects to `/login` (which handles both sign-in and sign-up)
- Keeps routing clean (users can still visit `/register`)
- Eliminates code duplication

### 3. Created Custom Hook Example

Added `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuthForm.example.ts`:
- Shows React's equivalent to Vue composables
- Demonstrates when and how to extract reusable logic
- Currently NOT used (keeping it simple)
- Reference for future refactoring if needed

## Architecture Decision: Keep It Simple

**Recommendation**: Keep current approach (unified Login.tsx)

**Reasons**:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Login.tsx handles all auth flows in one place
2. **Lightweight Frontend**: Aligns with API-first, Capacitor-ready architecture
3. **Less Code**: No need to duplicate UI components and logic
4. **Better UX**: Seamless toggle between sign-in and sign-up modes

## React Composables (Custom Hooks)

React's equivalent to Vue composables is **Custom Hooks**:

```typescript
// Vue Composable
export function useAuth() {
  const user = ref(null);
  const login = async () => { /* ... */ };
  return { user, login };
}

// React Custom Hook
export function useAuth() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const login = async () => { /* ... */ };
  return { user, login };
}
```

**When to use Custom Hooks**:
- Reusing logic across multiple components
- Extracting complex state management
- Testing logic separately from UI
- Component files getting too large (>300 lines)

**When NOT to use**:
- Single-use logic (keep it inline)
- Simple forms (current approach is fine)
- Premature optimization

## Current Architecture

```
apps/web/src/
├── pages/
│   ├── Login.tsx          # Handles sign-in AND sign-up
│   └── Register.tsx       # Redirects to Login
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.tsx    # Auth state + API calls
└── hooks/
    └── useAuthForm.example.ts  # Optional pattern (not used)
```

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript builds successfully
- ✅ Registration flow wired up
- ✅ Password validation working
- ✅ Error handling in place
- ✅ Navigation working

## Next Steps

1. Test registration in browser
2. Verify email/password validation
3. Test OAuth and magic link flows
4. Consider extracting to custom hook only if:
   - Adding more forms with similar logic
   - Login.tsx exceeds 300 lines
   - Need to test form logic separately

## Key Takeaway

For a lightweight, API-first frontend, the current inline approach is ideal. Custom hooks are great for reusable logic, but premature extraction adds unnecessary complexity.
