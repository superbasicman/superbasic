# Slim-Down Best Practices — Planning & Coordination

Guidelines to keep work focused, production-ready, and simple while we reshape the repo.

## Planning & Coordination

- When assigned with a task, before coding, write down numbered todo list using [ ] so we can later mark complete with [x]. At the end of each task add a short and sweet understandable acceptance criteria and/or sannity check if applicable. Keep README plans updated. Once task list is completed ask user to confirm before proceeding.
- Work in feature-aligned branches and open smaller PRs instead of giant dumps.
- Flag risky changes early (auth, billing, migrations) so we can plan rollbacks.
