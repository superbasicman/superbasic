# Product Overview

SuperBasic Finance is an API-first personal finance platform built in a monorepo. The web client is a thin React SPA that consumes a typed JSON API. Developers can provision API keys to build their own tools, with future MCP server support on the roadmap.

## Core Principles

- **API-first**: Stable /v1 JSON endpoints backed by Zod schemas with autogenerated OpenAPI 3.1 contract
- **Secure by design**: Auth.js + hashed PATs, least-privilege Prisma access, Upstash rate limits, auditable changes
- **Thin client**: React SPA calls public API exclusively; no direct DB access or secrets in web app
- **Portable**: Pure client-side architecture enables easy wrapping with Capacitor for mobile deployment
- **Extensible**: Workspace-aware multi-tenant, saved views, budgets, exports, fine-grained API scopes
- **Operationally simple**: Vercel deploys, serverless-friendly jobs, reproducible migrations

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Native mobile clients
- Spreadsheet-style UI
