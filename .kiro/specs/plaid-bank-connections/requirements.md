# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating Plaid Link to enable users to securely connect their bank accounts to SuperBasic Finance. The integration will support Link token creation, public token exchange, account metadata synchronization, and webhook handling for connection status updates. The system will store bank connection data in an append-only ledger pattern and provide users with visibility into their connected accounts.

## Glossary

- **Plaid_Link_System**: The client-side Plaid Link component that handles the bank connection flow
- **Token_Exchange_Service**: The server-side service that exchanges public tokens for access tokens
- **Connection_Manager**: The system component that manages bank connection lifecycle and metadata
- **Account_Sync_Service**: The service that fetches and stores account metadata from Plaid
- **Webhook_Handler**: The endpoint that processes asynchronous events from Plaid
- **Link_Token**: A short-lived token generated server-side to initialize Plaid Link
- **Public_Token**: A short-lived token returned by Plaid Link after successful connection
- **Access_Token**: A long-lived token used for API requests to Plaid (stored encrypted)
- **Item**: A Plaid object representing a user's connection to a financial institution
- **Connection**: The SuperBasic Finance representation of a Plaid Item with metadata
- **Account**: A bank account associated with a Connection (checking, savings, credit card, etc.)
- **Plaid_Sandbox**: The Plaid test environment for development and testing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my bank accounts through a secure interface, so that I can view my financial data in SuperBasic Finance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates the bank connection flow, THE Plaid_Link_System SHALL display the Plaid Link interface with available financial institutions
2. WHEN a user selects a financial institution and provides valid credentials, THE Plaid_Link_System SHALL return a public_token to the client application
3. WHEN the client receives a public_token, THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL exchange it for an access_token within 5 seconds
4. WHEN the Token_Exchange_Service receives an access_token from Plaid, THE Connection_Manager SHALL store the connection with encrypted access_token in the database
5. WHEN a connection is successfully created, THE Account_Sync_Service SHALL fetch and store account metadata within 10 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Link tokens generated server-side with proper user context, so that bank connections are securely associated with the correct user

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL generate Link tokens only for authenticated users with valid session or API token
2. WHEN generating a Link token, THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL include the user's profile_id in the Plaid API request
3. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL set the Link token webhook URL to the application's webhook endpoint
4. WHEN a Link token request fails, THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL return an error response with status code 500 and error details
5. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL generate Link tokens that remain valid for 30 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my connected bank accounts in one place, so that I can manage my connections and view account details

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Connection_Manager SHALL provide an endpoint that returns all connections for the authenticated user
2. WHEN retrieving connections, THE Connection_Manager SHALL include account metadata for each connection
3. THE Connection_Manager SHALL display account name, institution name, account type, account mask, and current balance for each account
4. WHEN an account balance is unavailable, THE Connection_Manager SHALL display the last known balance with a timestamp
5. THE Connection_Manager SHALL sort accounts by institution name and then by account type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified when my bank connection requires attention, so that I can re-authenticate and maintain data sync

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Plaid sends an ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED webhook event, THE Webhook_Handler SHALL update the connection status to 'error'
2. WHEN a connection status changes to 'error', THE Connection_Manager SHALL record the error details and timestamp
3. THE Connection_Manager SHALL provide an endpoint that returns connections requiring re-authentication
4. WHEN a user views their connections list, THE Plaid_Link_System SHALL display a visual indicator for connections with 'error' status
5. WHEN a user initiates re-authentication, THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL generate a Link token in update mode for the specific Item

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all Plaid API interactions logged and monitored, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure security

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL log all Link token creation requests with user_id, profile_id, and timestamp
2. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL log all public token exchanges with success or failure status
3. THE Webhook_Handler SHALL log all incoming webhook events with event type, item_id, and timestamp
4. WHEN a Plaid API request fails, THE Connection_Manager SHALL log the error code, error message, and request context
5. THE Connection_Manager SHALL verify webhook signatures using HMAC-SHA256 before processing events

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect bank accounts I no longer use, so that I can manage my data privacy and security

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Connection_Manager SHALL provide an endpoint to soft-delete connections by setting deleted_at timestamp
2. WHEN a user deletes a connection, THE Connection_Manager SHALL mark all associated accounts as deleted
3. WHEN a connection is deleted, THE Connection_Manager SHALL NOT delete historical transaction data
4. THE Connection_Manager SHALL exclude deleted connections from the user's connections list
5. WHEN a connection is deleted, THE Connection_Manager SHALL log the deletion event with user_id, connection_id, and timestamp

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Plaid integration to work in both Sandbox and Production environments, so that I can test safely before deploying

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL use environment-specific Plaid API credentials based on NODE_ENV configuration
2. WHEN NODE_ENV is 'development' or 'test', THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL use Plaid Sandbox environment
3. WHEN NODE_ENV is 'production', THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL use Plaid Production environment
4. THE Connection_Manager SHALL store the Plaid environment identifier with each connection
5. THE Plaid_Link_System SHALL display environment indicators in non-production environments

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my bank credentials to never be stored by SuperBasic Finance, so that my sensitive information remains secure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Plaid_Link_System SHALL handle all credential input through Plaid's hosted interface
2. THE Token_Exchange_Service SHALL NOT log or store user credentials at any point
3. THE Connection_Manager SHALL store only access_tokens encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption

5. WHEN retrieving access_tokens, THE Connection_Manager SHALL decrypt them only in memory for API requests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time feedback during the bank connection process, so that I understand what's happening

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Plaid_Link_System is initializing, THE client application SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN the public token exchange is in progress, THE client application SHALL display a processing message
3. WHEN account sync is in progress, THE client application SHALL display a syncing indicator
