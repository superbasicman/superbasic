1. [ ] Capture target v1 schema scope for this reset (tables, key invariants, and referenced steering docs) — AC: short checklist in the task file citing the docs and enumerating every table we plan to implement right now.
2. [ ] Replace the current Prisma schema with the v1 tables (UUID PKs, `email_lower`, hashed token columns, profile/workspace scaffolding) — AC: `packages/database/schema.prisma` matches the documented columns/types/naming and passes `pnpm prisma validate`.
3. [ ] Regenerate baseline SQL migrations that align with the new schema (including constraints, indexes, and helper functions/RLS stubs called out in the docs) — AC: `packages/database/migrations` contains the fresh sequence and `pnpm prisma migrate deploy --schema packages/database/schema.prisma` succeeds against pg-mem.
4. [ ] Update supporting code/tests (Prisma client bootstrap, auth/package tests, and any docs referencing the old schema) to reflect the reset — AC: vitest suites under `packages/auth` pass locally with the new database package and docs mention the updated baseline.
